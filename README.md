# EP

This repo is a collection of music as SuperCollider code that was performed on the 17th of may 2022, as part of my final concert at the Bachelors studies in electroacoustic music at Kungliga Musikhögskolan in Stockholm.  
The music has been recorded and can be found at my soundcloud [here](https://soundcloud.com/viktorsandstrm).

Some pieces is lacking the audiofiles needed for the pieces to be performed, but others should be complete. 

I am using my own help-class to a MIDI-device called [16n](https://16n-faderbank.github.io/)
It is represented as the object:

```supercollider
SixteenFaders.new
```
This class can be obtained at [this](github.com/vsandstrom/SixteenFaders) repo.
